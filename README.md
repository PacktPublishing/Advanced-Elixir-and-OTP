## About the Video Course
Elixir is a dynamic, functional language designed for building scalable and maintainable applications. Elixir leverages the Erlang VM, known for running low-latency, distributed, and fault-tolerant systems, while also being successfully used in web development and the embedded software domain.

In this course, we delve into more advanced features of the Elixir language. We explore the concurrent aspects of the language, how to manipulate complex data structures efficiently, meta programming, and OTP.
By the end of this course, you'll have learned advanced topics on the Elixir language and OTP, as well as how to apply them to build robust modern applications.
